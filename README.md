# The-Goblin-s-Cave
Description:

The Goblin’s Cave is a 4 level 2D side-scroller platformer. The player is in a cave where the mains enemies are goblins and mushrooms warriors. The game features standard ActionAdventure games mechanics such as attacks, jumps, melee and range enemies and so on. The main objective of the game is to manage to collect all the coins (only collectible in the game) in levels without losing the 3 lives the players get at the beginning of the game. If the player looses its three lives, he is given the opportunity to restart the game from the beginning.

I made this simple platformer to enhance my ability to use Unity’s Tilemaps system as well as coding more advanced features in C#. It is also during this project I got interested in programming patterns such as singletons. 

Gameplay: 

The player can: move forward/backward, jump, attack with a sword. 
Starts with 150 of life for the level and Three lives for the entire game.
The coins' collection counter is displayed in the top right corner of the screen.

Three types of enemies
1. Mushroom warrior: Melee enemy, fast-paced attack, difficulty to kill = easy
2. Green Goblin: Range enemy, throw rocks at the player, difficulty to kill = Medium
3. Red Goblin: Melee enemy, slow-paced attack, difficulty to kill = Hard

Three types of trap as you go through levels (One Shot the player):
1. Dropping spikes: drops from the ceiling when the player passes under it.
2. Hole: most of the time between two platforms, the player needs to jump over those holes. If he fails, the player looses a life on the spike down the hole.
3. Lava: the lava is only really present in the last level (level 4).
