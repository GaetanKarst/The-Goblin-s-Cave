# The-Goblin-s-Cave
The Golin’s Cave is a 4 level 2D side-scroller platformer featuring standard ActionAdventure games mechanics such as attacks, jumps, enemies and collectibles. The main purpose of this game was to enhance my ability to use Unity’s Tilemaps system as well as coding some more advanced features in C#.
